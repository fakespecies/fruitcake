=========
An HTML5 interactive cover song - in time for the holiday season! Just click on an ingredient icon to listen to the audio loop with the rest of the mix.
This project was created at the Scene 2014 Holiday Hackathon in Cleveland. We are still working on some features and testing for bugs.

To Do:
  -clean-up spacing and layout
  -add drag and drop into bowl
  -add a loop "preview" on click
  -add ending section to song after all ingredients are in the bowl
  -fix loop timing with an audio event lookahead window
